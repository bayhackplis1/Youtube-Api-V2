# YouTube Music Downloader

## Overview

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to search for and download music from YouTube. The application features a Matrix-themed user interface with a hacker aesthetic, utilizing yt-dlp for YouTube video extraction and download functionality. Users can either paste YouTube URLs directly or search for videos by name, then download them in various formats.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack**: The frontend uses vanilla JavaScript with Bootstrap 5 (dark theme variant) for UI components and Font Awesome for icons.

**Design Pattern**: Single-page application approach where the main interface is served from a single HTML template (`index.html`). User interactions trigger AJAX requests to backend endpoints without full page reloads.

**UI Theme**: Custom Matrix/hacker aesthetic implemented through CSS animations and a canvas-based Matrix rain background effect. The design uses green-on-black color scheme with pulsing glow effects on UI elements.

**Rationale**: This approach provides a responsive, interactive user experience while keeping the codebase simple. The Matrix theme differentiates the application visually and creates an engaging user experience.

### Backend Architecture

**Framework**: Flask web framework running as a lightweight Python web server.

**Core Functionality**: 
- URL validation and YouTube search via yt-dlp library
- Video metadata extraction
- File download handling through temporary file system storage
- REST API endpoints for programmatic access

**API Endpoints**: The application provides RESTful API endpoints for external integration:
- `/api/download/video?url=URL` - Download video by direct YouTube URL (returns MP4)
- `/api/download/audio?url=URL` - Download audio by direct YouTube URL (returns MP3)
- `/api/download/search/video?q=QUERY` - Search and download first video result (returns MP4)
- `/api/download/search/audio?q=QUERY` - Search and download first audio result (returns MP3)

**Session Management**: Uses Flask's built-in session handling with a secret key (configurable via environment variable `SESSION_SECRET`, falls back to random generation in development).

**Rationale**: Flask was chosen for its simplicity and ease of deployment. The application doesn't require complex routing or middleware, making Flask an ideal lightweight solution. The yt-dlp library provides robust YouTube interaction capabilities without requiring direct API integration. API endpoints enable programmatic access for external applications and automation.

### Data Storage

**Current Implementation**: No persistent database. The application uses temporary file storage for downloaded videos/audio files.

**File Management**: Python's `tempfile` module handles temporary file creation during download operations.

**Rationale**: Since this is a download utility with no user accounts or persistent state requirements, a database is unnecessary. Temporary files are cleaned up automatically by the operating system, reducing storage management complexity.

**Future Consideration**: If user preferences, download history, or queuing features are added, a lightweight database like SQLite could be introduced.

### Security & Configuration

**Environment Variables**: 
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Flask session encryption key

**Logging**: Comprehensive logging configured at DEBUG level for troubleshooting YouTube extraction issues.

**URL Validation**: Custom validation function checks URLs against YouTube domain patterns before processing.

**Rationale**: Environment-based configuration allows for secure deployment across different environments. Debug logging aids in diagnosing yt-dlp extraction issues which can be complex.

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Libraries

**yt-dlp**: Primary dependency for YouTube video extraction, metadata retrieval, and download functionality. This is a maintained fork of youtube-dl with active development and bug fixes.

**Flask**: Web framework for handling HTTP requests, template rendering, and response generation.

**Bootstrap 5**: CSS framework for responsive UI components, specifically using the dark theme variant hosted on Replit's CDN.

**Font Awesome 6**: Icon library for visual elements throughout the interface.

### External Services

**YouTube**: The application's core functionality depends on YouTube's video platform. Interactions occur through yt-dlp's abstraction layer rather than direct API calls.

**Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**:
- `cdn.replit.com`: Hosts Bootstrap theme
- `cdn.jsdelivr.net`: Hosts Font Awesome icons

**Rationale**: Using yt-dlp instead of YouTube's official API avoids API quota limitations and OAuth complexity. CDN-hosted assets reduce server bandwidth and leverage browser caching. The trade-off is potential breaking changes if YouTube modifies its underlying structure, though yt-dlp maintainers typically provide rapid updates.

### Browser APIs

**Canvas API**: Used for rendering the animated Matrix rain background effect.

**Fetch API**: Handles asynchronous communication with backend endpoints for search and download operations.
